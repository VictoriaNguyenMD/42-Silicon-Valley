1. In the most concise way possible, answer this question, what is 42? How would you describe 42 to someone who doesn’t know what 42 is?

An intensive tuition-free computer science program that emphasizes peer learning.

2. Why are there no instructions on the initial 42 logic tests?

The initial logic tests are actually no longer mandatory for 42 participants. However, there are no instructions on the logic tests because 42 wants to see if you are able to work through a problem given to you with little to minimal guidance, a philosophy that is hounded in you once you arrive to 42 and participate in the Piscine. There are, of course, other possible reasons, but they key component of 42 is to see whether or not you will jsut give up or try to work through the problem and find a solution.

3. What are the core 42 principles?

For me, one core 42 principle is to provide people a chance to learn coding regardless of their income, grades, background, or nationality. The students at 42 have the option of registering for free dorms and obtain paid internships to help offset some of the costs living in a city, especially Silicon Valley, where rent prices are notorious for being expensive. In addition, as a tuition-free school, the founder, Xavier Niel, had dreams of creating a setting in which peers learn from each other. As a result, this school is heavily based on peer-learning as well as project-based learning. By having minimal fees, Xavier hopes to minimize any barriers to education. Furthermore, 42 prepares students for what they may experience in a company setting as a software engineer since there may not be someone on one's team is aware of how to solve a problem. C language is used because it is the foundation of most, if not all, other programming languages. Other programming languages, such as Python, may evolve overtime, but if you know C, then you have the capabilities of understanding other languages because it is the foundation for many computer science languages.

4. If somebody is thinking of going to 42, but has no coding experience - do you really think it’s worth their time?

Of course! As a Biology major who is interested in becoming a physician in the future, I had very little coding experiences coming to 42. I never new about version control (Git) or even what to use GitHub for. After graduating 42, I realized the importance of creating an online presence as a non-computer science major interested in merging technology and medicine as a future physician innovator. 42 is worth people's time because you gain soft skills, such as becoming more comfortable talking to people and asking questions, as well as hard skills, such as coding in C and learning Git. Honestly, I am not fond of the traditional United States education system in which we are thrown with textbooks and told to just read and remember rather than apply. I know numerous people who are computer science majors but who are unable to code. They have the knowledge of how a computer works and what to use, but they do not actually know how to solve real-world problems using computer science. In addition, a lot of the students often complain about their teachers or not understanding a project because of the lack of directions. If there are no directions, then ask what to do. If you are unable to find someone to ask, then try to figure it out yourself. We live in the world of technology. We have access to the internet, to forums, to people across the world. We are not limited by knowledge, but we are limited by time and by societal norms. College degrees aren't necessary, but society makes it feel like they are sometimes. On the other hand, the traditional education system may be suitable for some people based on their learning styles, but it is not suitable for me. I love freedom and the ability to learn what I want to learn around a group of students who are as passionate and as eager to learn as me. This is the future of educations -- using hands-on, project-based learning. Even if you are not interested in computer science, consider joining 42 just to gain the experience of a different kind of education system.

5. What makes 42 unique?

42 is unique for many reasons. I'm smiling reading this question because it is everything but following the norms. Society dictates that there should be teachers. There are no teachers at 42. Society states that failure in the academic setting is bad. At 42, you are bound to fail one if not many days/projects. Society states that higher edcuation often costs money. 42 is free. Society dictates that you must be a certain age to do something. 42 is for 18 and above; howevever, there is Hack Highschool as well as CodeForFree in the same building. 42 is unique because they grade you on your effort and how quickly you are to learn. You are judged based on yourself. If you failed everything and still are able to pass in the last week of the Piscine, you have a chance of still being accepted. 42 looks at improvement as well as your performance, but, with someone with little coding background, they know that you might not have all the tools under your belt. 42 is additionally unique because it is international and intercultural. There are several campuses around the world, and once we receive a certain level, we are able to transfer to another campus to gain a different kind of learning experience around a different cohort of people. I absolutely love that 42 contains a wide range of cultures, with people from all around the world. You are forced to interact with people you may not have a background with, people 10 years older than you, etc. Age and cultures are not barriers at 42. It's almost as if racism does not exist. Income does not matter. Race does not matter. Age does not matter. You are all treated the same. These are a few reasons why 42 is unique but there are many more.

6. What do you think you’re learning the most at 42?

Apart from learning how to code in C, problem solving and dealing with unexpected situations. I have never been in a situation in which I have been given so much freedom before. I drove up 8 hours with my parents to 42 to become a cadet. Do I know how to drive? No...not quite. Yes, I have a car. Yes, I have my license. However, I have not really drived yet since I didn't need to drive in university, and even if I have a navigator, everyone is scared of getting in a car with me as a driver. So, yes, I am learning independence at 42. I learning how to budget since I no longer have a meal plan or a steady job with solid income. Yes, I'm learning how to deal with instances in which I may be locked outside of a whole entire dorm building. Yes, I am learning how to figure out how to live with 3 other people in a dorm room. Yes, I am learning how to be in a room full of guys as a female and not be intimidated. Yes, I am learning how to join the tech world and no longer begin my speech with, "I'm a Biology major interested in computer science." Yes, I'm figuring out that this world is full of crazy people, such as the lady who keeps on trying to steal people's kitties. However, this is life. Things will arise unexpectedly, but how it affects you is determined by you alone. So, what am I learning the most at 42? Problem solving to sum it up.

7. Imagine (this will happen very soon in real life!), you’ve been stuck on the problem for a while and have no idea what to do - what your next steps would be?

Google. The first step we learned is that Google is our best friend. Google has a wealth of information, so we must find someone in the world with a similar problem. Next, we would then ask our peers/friends/support group for aid. If you tried it for a long time  yourself, and you have Googled it, then ask those around you. If they are uncertain, then take a break, and try again! Don't give up. However, if there is a deadline and you must complete several assignments, then move on. Google is your best friend. Don't forget that.

8. How will you ensure that your personal level of motivation remains high on a daily basis to complete at least 1 level per month without the Piscine pressure and strict dead- lines?

I am motivated to build my online presence as a future physician innovator. The medical field lacks technology right now (in terms of the newer technology), so I would like to become the bridge between the two fields. My personal level of motivation will remain high on a daily basis because I will keep on uploading the information that I do to GitHub or an online portfolio to build my presence. Also, I will keep my personal level of motivation high by watching all of my friends' stories who are at tech companies enjoying the free food and fun games. 

9. If someone asks you why it says internships are required on the 42 website, but they do not offer job placement, what would you say?

They require internships because they want you to experience the real world of software engineering. They do not offer job placement because if you are unable to code well, they cannot guarantee you a job. They want you to still compete in the world of software engineering to obtain an interview and subsequently a job.

10. How do the internships work? Is it mandatory that you have to reach a certain level before leaving on an internship or can you validate it anytime you find one?

The internships are 4-6 months usually. In addition, there is an optional part-time internship after completing 2/3 of their academic career. The final internship is a 6-month process that will be the gateway to the job market. When students reach level 7, they have a choice to do an internship, but you can, of course, find your own internship by yourself (no one will stop you :D).

11. How does 42 help you adapt to a work place?  

42 helps you adapt to the work place because you are challenged to succeed in a place with very little guidance. The work place may not always be nuturing new employees toward success, so you may have to learn on your own. 42 makes a software engineer versatile, especially in terms of figuring out how to solve problems on his/her own. 42 creates a community that you can rely on and shows you how it is to be in front of a computer for 9-16 hours a day. Instead of showing you though, it puts you into the life of what a software engineer's life may be, with the exception of like the top tech companies (eg. Google, Microsoft, etc.) in which the employees are given free meals.

Bonus
xwang: he is a level 5 cadet who is currently studying at 42. He participated in the Boost program. He is currently taking a Python course at UC Berkeley (CS61A). They offer offer amazing videos and exercises on the course website. He recommends looking at the program to learn Python and to gain a better foundation for computer science.

mbrave: a very helpful gentleman who is a level 5 software engineer who I believe also blogged some of his post or likes to read blog posts about 42. He partnered with EDHEC Partnership Project pt. 1 and Build the Bay - Hackathon.

JoChang: a level 10 individual who has excellent exam marks. Participated mentoring highschoolers in HackHihSchool and H2S Mentorship. For non-42 related stuff, the individual works in a fiber optic research company, doing a lot of math on light waves. For 42, the individual did ComputorV1 out of boredom. This is a polynomial calculator, using Python.

marrodri: otherwise known as Marthel. I had evaluataed him and he informed me he was previously a 3D modeling major. He is interested in possibly using 3D modeling and software engineering in the future. He has been at 42 for almost 3/4 of a year and is currently working on an encryption project called ft_ssl_md5.
