**Typedef: defines a new datatype. It can be used for creating an alias name for a datatype
typedef struct employee
{
	int id;
	char name[30];
}record; //structure employee has a new alias called "record"

----------

**Macros: a fragment of code often defined using #define. This is a preprocessor. When a macro (aka name) is called in the program, it will replace the fragment of code that was defined in the macro. Macros can be a code block, loops, functions, etc. "find and replace"
#define MAXIMUM(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b)) //Macro defined
printf("Biggest number among the two is %d\n", MAXIMUM(50,25));
